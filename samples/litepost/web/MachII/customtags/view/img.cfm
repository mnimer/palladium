Notes:
- REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES
	src		= [string] The path or the shortcut to the image
	alt		= [string] The alternative text for the image (if not defined this is included)
- OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTES (BUT REQUIRED BY THE API)
	width	= [string|numeric|null] The width of the image in pixels or percentage if a percent sign `%` is defined. A value of '-1' will cause this attribute to be omitted. Auto dimension are applied when zero-length string is used.
	height	= [string|numeric|null] The height of the image in pixels or percentage if a percent sign `%` is defined. A value of '-1' will cause this attribute to be omitted. Auto dimension are applied when zero-length string is used.
